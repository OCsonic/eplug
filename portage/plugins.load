# For people using ehook prior to the new system, you can just rename "package.hook" to "hook"
#  and enable the legacy ehook plugin and disable the new ehook plugin. The legacy plugin will
#  continue to be supported as it is the reference implementation for "type 3" configuration
#  based plugins.
